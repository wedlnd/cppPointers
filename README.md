# c++ Pointers How To for Beginners

I tried learning c++ pointers the other day, and realized that all of the explanations that I could find were quite complicated, especially if you are new to programming.
In order to mitigate that issue, I created a little console workthrough that showcases how pointers work in a simple manner.

#### This is by no means the only information that you need to understand pointers!!!

My goal in making this was to help myself understand how addresses and dereferencing works when using pointers. From what I have seen so far, a lot of people starting out in c++ get hung up on pointers and lose hope. I hope this can help you push through and grasp the concept better through whatever classes or books you are learning through.

### How to best work through this:
Copy and paste the file into your preferred editor and read through the console output, taking note of the changes that are made on the corresponding lines in the file.
